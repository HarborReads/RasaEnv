responses:
  utter_initial_greeting:

  utter_uncertain_characters:
    - text: "No worries! Let me help you figure that out. Do you have any specific traits in characters that you find interesting, like bravery, humor, or complexity?"

  utter_certain_characters:
    - text: "Nice choice! Specific character traits can really enhance the reading experience. Now, let's talk about relatability. Do you prefer stories with characters you can relate to, or do you enjoy more fantastical and unique characters?"

  utter_preference_relatable_characters:

  utter_preference_action_emotion:
    - text: "Excellent! Balancing action and emotional moments can create a rich reading experience. Now, when it comes to length, do you prefer shorter, quick reads, or do you enjoy getting lost in longer, more immersive novels?"

    - text: "Got it! Some readers enjoy a good balance of action and emotion, while others have specific preferences. Now, let's talk about book length. Do you have a preference for shorter or longer books?"

  utter_share_entertainment_preferences:
    - text: "That's helpful information! Adventure movies often have exciting plots, and sports video games reflect your interest in sports. Based on this, you might enjoy books with adventurous plots and maybe some sports-related elements. How does that sound?"
